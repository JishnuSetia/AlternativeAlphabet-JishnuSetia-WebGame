                        <ol>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Choose Number of Players:</strong> Gather your friends and select the number of players for your game session. Whether you're playing with a small group or a larger crowd, "The Alternative Alphabet" accommodates everyone.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Automatic Card Selection:</strong> Once the players are set, the game automatically selects both action and word cards for each participant. These cards set the stage for the game's interactive challenges.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Action and Word Matching:</strong> Each player receives an action card and a word card. The objective is to perform the action described on the card in relation to the word provided. This unique pairing encourages creative thinking and prompts insightful discussions.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Perform and Respond:</strong> Players must execute the action prompted by their card and provide their response to the designated word. For example, if the action card instructs "Express," and the word card is "Anxiety," the player may share their thoughts, feelings, or experiences related to anxiety.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                              <strong>AI Assessment:</strong> After each player completes their action and response, an AI-powered system evaluates their input. The system determines whether the response aligns with the intended purpose of the game.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Scoring and Rewards:</strong> Points are awarded to players based on the quality of their performance and the relevance of their responses. This scoring system encourages thoughtful engagement and fosters a deeper understanding of mental health concepts.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>
                              <strong>Victory and Recognition:</strong> The player with the highest accumulated points at the end of the game emerges as the winner. Beyond victory, every participant gains invaluable insights into mental health and enhances their communication skills in navigating these crucial conversations.
